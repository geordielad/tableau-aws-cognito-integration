AWS Cognito can be an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for Tableau Server. Cognito will need a User Pool to be configured and an Application in that User Pool can be configured to support an OIDC Authorization Code Flow. In terms of the OIDC standard, Tableau is the Relying Party and can be considered a confidential client.
